# Workflow:

# 3. Create a folder

# mkdir project_name

# 4. Go to the folder (assuming you are already in correct path)

# cd project_name

# 5. Set up git repository

# git remote add origin git@github.com:your_id/project_name.git
# 8. Go to the folder
# cd project_path/project_name
# 9. Write code
